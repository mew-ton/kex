# Documentation Guidelines (Ref: Kex)

This project uses [Kex](https://github.com/mew-ton/kex) for knowledge management.

**PRIMARY DIRECTIVE (STRICT):**
Before writing, editing, or restructuring any documentation, you **MUST** first search the knowledge base using **Kex MCP** for style guides and conventions.

**The "Search Signal" Protocol:**
1.  **ACKNOWLEDGE**: When you receive a documentation task, your *very first* reaction must be "I need to check the style guidelines."
2.  **SEARCH**: Execute `search_documents` immediately.
    *   **Keywords**: "documentation", "style", "markdown", "format", "naming".
    *   **Critical:** If `kex` tools are unavailable or fail, **STOP** and report this to the user.
3.  **VERIFY**: You are forbidden from proceeding until you have read relevant guidelines.

**Adding New Knowledge**
1.  **Search existing structure** to understand where new files belong.
2.  **Check for conflicts** using `Glob` or filesystem tools (only for this purpose).
3.  **Create Markdown files** with valid Frontmatter (id, title, description, keywords).
4.  **Run `kex check`** to validate.

**Language Synchronization (EN/JA)**
*   **Requirement**: When updating documentation, you MUST update both English (`docs/`) and Japanese (`docs/ja/`) versions simultaneously.
*   **Consistency**: Ensure the content structure and key information match across languages.

**Forbidden Actions**:
*   Do NOT use `grep`, `cat`, or file system tools to read/search existing content in `{{.Root}}/` for the purpose of "learning the style". Use Kex tools ONLY.
