# Write Effective Descriptions

When writing documentation managed by Kex, the `description` field in the frontmatter is critical. It is used not only for human readability but also as a primary signal for AI Agents (like Claude or Cursor) to retrieve the correct context (Skills).

## The "When/What" Format

You **MUST** write descriptions that directly state the context and the content's purpose or requirement, without meta-instructions like "use this to".

### Format

```yaml
description: When [Context/Trigger], [Action/Requirement/Fact].
```

### Examples

**Good:**
> description: When implementing authentication flows, security tokens must be validated.

**Good:**
> description: When writing Go code, Clean Architecture principles and directory structure rules apply.

**Bad (Meta-instruction):**
> description: When writing Go code, **use this to** enforce Clean Architecture.

**Bad (Vague):**
> description: Authentication documentation.

## Why This Matters

AI Agents use semantic matching. Removing filler phrasing like "use this to" increases the density of meaningful keywords (Context + Action) and improves retrieval accuracy.
