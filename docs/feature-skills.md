# AI Skills

Kex can generate **Dynamic Skills** for compatible AI agents:

- **Google Antigravity**
- **Claude Desktop**
- **Claude Code**
- **Cursor**

## What are Skills?

Skills are dynamic rule files that Kex generates based on your documentation. Unlike static MCP rules (which are fixed instructions), Skills are essentially **retrieval-augmented prompts**.

- Kex scans your documentation directory.
- It finds documents matching your configured `keywords`.
- It generates a "Skill" file (e.g., `.claude/skills/kex/go.md`) that summarizes these documents.

## How it Works

When `kex update` runs:

1.  It checks `.kex.yaml` for `ai-skills` configuration.
2.  It uses the `keywords` to perform a search in your knowledge base.
3.  It retrieves relevant documents (title, description, path).
4.  It injects this list into a Skill template (e.g., `assets/templates/.claude/skills/kex/skill.md.template`).
5.  It saves the result to your repo (e.g., `.claude/skills/kex/my-skill.md`).

## Configuration

In `.kex.yaml`:

```yaml
update:
  ai-skills:
    targets: [claude, cursor, antigravity]        # Agents to generate skills for
    keywords: [go, testing]  # Keywords to gather knowledge about
```

This configuration tells Kex: "Find all documents related to `go` or `testing`, and create a Skill for Claude so it knows we have guidelines about these topics."

## Benefits

- **Context Awareness**: The agent knows *what* guidelines exist without reading every file.
- **Token Efficiency**: The Skill file only contains summaries, not full content.
- **Discovery**: The agent can then use the `search_documents` MCP tool to read the specific details when needed.

## Best Practices

### Version Control (.gitignore)

Since Skill files are automatically generated by `kex update`, it is recommended to **exclude them from version control**. This keeps your repository clean and enforces `kex update` as the source of truth.

Add the following to your `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Kex Generated Skills
.agent/skills/kex.*
.claude/skills/kex.*
.cursor/skills/kex.*
```
