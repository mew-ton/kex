## Summary
Use consistent naming conventions to communicate intent and scope.

## Guidance
- **PascalCase**: Classes, Interfaces, Types, Components (Astro/Vue etc), Structs (Go export).
- **camelCase**: Variables, functions, methods, fields.
- **kebab-case**: Filenames (web), CSS classes, URLs.
- **UPPER_CASE**: Constants.

## Rationale
Consistency reduces cognitive load and allows predicting names.
