## Summary
Assign keywords that cover three specific dimensions: Object, Symptom/Problem, and Concept/Quality.

## Rationale
Users (and AIs) search with different intents:
- **Object intent**: "I am working on a *function*."
- **Symptom intent**: "My code is too *long*."
- **Concept intent**: "I want to improve *readability*."
Covering all three ensures the guideline is found in any context.

## Guidance
For every guideline, add keywords for:

1.  **Object**: The concrete entity being modified.
    - *Examples*: `function`, `variable`, `file`, `import`, `error`.
2.  **Symptom/Problem**: What the user observes, feels, or suffers from.
    - *Examples*: `length`, `complexity`, `large`, `bug`, `silent-failure`.
3.  **Concept/Quality**: The theoretical principle or goal.
    - *Examples*: `readability`, `maintainability`, `atomic-design`, `dry`, `safety`.

## Examples
### For `keep-functions-short.md`
- **Object**: `function`
- **Symptom**: `length`, `complexity`, `size`
- **Concept**: `readability`, `decomposition`
