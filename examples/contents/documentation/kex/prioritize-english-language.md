## Summary
Write content primarily in English. This maximizes compatibility and performance with current AI models.

## Rationale
- **AI Performance**: Most LLMs are trained predominantly on English text, resulting in higher accuracy and better reasoning.
- **Token Efficiency**: English often uses fewer tokens than other languages for the same semantic content in many tokenizers.
- **Universality**: English serves as a common ground for international teams.

## Guidance
1.  **Default to English**: Use English for filenames, frontmatter, and body content.
2.  **Future Proofing**: This rule may be relaxed as AI models bridge the performance gap between languages.
3.  **Exceptions**: If the project is strictly targeted at a non-English speaking audience, native language is acceptable.
