# Antigravity Coding Guidelines

You have access to the `kex` MCP server in this workspace.

**Rule:** Before modifying or creating code, you MUST:
1.  **Search for relevant coding guidelines** using the `kex-workspace` MCP tool `search_documents`.
    *   Examples: "logging", "error handling", "project structure", "naming conventions".
2.  **Read the relevant documents** using `read_document`.
3.  **Adhere strictly** to the guidelines found.

**Note:** This workspace uses a local binary `./kex` for the MCP server to ensure stability.
If the `./kex` binary is missing or if the MCP server fails to start, you MUST run:
```bash
make build
```
before attempting to use MCP tools again.


Always ensure you are following the project's own documentation ("Dogfooding").
